## Hi 👋

I work at the intersection of **pharmaceutical analytics** and
**demand forecasting**, focusing on practical, data-driven systems
for real-world pharmacy environments.

My main interest is building **local-first forecasting solutions**
that prioritize data privacy, interpretability, and reproducibility
over black-box automation.

---

## What I’m currently working on

- **AI-Pharm Analytics** — a demand forecasting system for pharmacy sales data  
- Time series forecasting at the **individual product (SKU) level**  
- Data workflows that transform real-world Excel reports into
  model-ready datasets  
- Designing forecasting pipelines suitable for on-premise deployment

---

## Technical focus

- **Python**
- **Time series analysis** (SARIMA and related models)
- **Machine learning** (e.g., gradient boosting)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for real-world sales data
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE

---

## How I approach projects

- Start with **data reality**, not idealized datasets  
- Separate user-facing data formats from internal representations  
- Prefer transparent, reproducible models over opaque solutions  
- Design systems that can evolve into integrations, not one-off scripts
